### Build tools, developer happiness

I have heard and read too many good things about webpack 2 and i cant wait to try it.

I currently rely on webpack 1 in production. Webpack 1 doesnt have tree shaking, thats 1 of its current major limitations for me for now.
Enter roll up; roll up has tree shaking support and it can integrate via webpack by means of a webpack loader. 
There is currently a webpack-rollup loader and plugin folks are using but it didnt work for me. :(
