### Algebric data types, ramda and fantasy land

For almost a year I have found the concept of integrating algebric data types in my work as the next step in my function programming journey. 
Currently the [fantasy land algebric](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) data spec is what I have my eyes set on. 

A mix of it plus ramda would be the holy grail of FP in Javascript for me.
My goal this first quarter of 2017 is to gain a firm understanding of the fantasy land spec and start using it in production.
